# Play Framework 3.0.5 and Apache Pekko 1.0.2 Upgrade

## Overview

This document describes the upgrade of userorg-service from Play Framework 2.7.2 with Akka 2.5.22 to Play Framework 3.0.5 with Apache Pekko 1.0.2.

- Actor Framework: Akka 2.5.22 to Apache Pekko 1.0.2
- Scala: 2.12.11 to 2.13.12
- Guice: 3.0 to 5.1.0
- SLF4J: 1.6.1 to 2.0.9
- Logback: 1.2.3 to 1.4.14
- Jackson: 2.13.5 to 2.14.3
- Netty: 4.1.44 to 4.1.93

## Key Changes

### Dependencies

All Maven POM files updated with new versions. Play Framework groupId changed from com.typesafe.play to org.playframework. Scala library exclusions added to prevent version conflicts between Scala 2.12 and 2.13.

### Source Code

329 Akka imports migrated to Pekko across 130+ Java files:
- akka.actor.* to org.apache.pekko.actor.*
- akka.pattern.* to org.apache.pekko.pattern.*
- akka.routing.* to org.apache.pekko.routing.*
- akka.util.* to org.apache.pekko.util.*
- akka.testkit.* to org.apache.pekko.testkit.*

### Configuration

application.conf files updated with Pekko namespaces:
- akka {} to pekko {}
- Actor system configurations migrated
- Serialization bindings updated
- Dispatcher references changed

### Play 3.0 API Updates

- ActorStartModule: Implements play.libs.pekko.PekkoGuiceSupport
- CustomGzipFilter: Updated to Play 3.0 filter API
- ErrorHandler: Migrated exception handling to Pekko

### Test Framework

38+ test files updated:
- Replaced JavaTestKit.duration() with java.time.Duration.ofSeconds()
- Resolved Duration class ambiguity between java.time and scala.concurrent
- Fixed import conflicts

### Scala Version Conflicts

Added exclusions to prevent Scala 2.12 transitive dependencies:
- Excluded scala-library and scala-reflect from cloud-store-sdk in platform-common
- Excluded scala-library and scala-reflect from platform-common and service dependencies in controller
- Explicitly declared scala-library 2.13.12 dependency

## Build Instructions

Build all modules:
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

Build with test compilation:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Create distribution package:
```
cd controller
mvn play2:dist
```

## Migration Impact

Business Logic: No changes to business logic or functionality
API Compatibility: Maintained, as Pekko is API-compatible with Akka 2.6
Code Changes: Primarily package name updates from akka to pekko
License: Now compliant with Apache 2.0 throughout the stack

## Testing Recommendations

1. Execute full unit test suite
2. Run integration tests for actor communication
3. Perform regression testing for all features
4. Conduct performance benchmarking
5. Test under production-like load

## Files Modified

- POM files
- Java source files
- configuration files
- test files

## Known Issues

Scala 2.12/2.13 Conflict: If you encounter NoClassDefFoundError for scala.collection.GenMap, verify dependency tree to ensure no Scala 2.12 artifacts are present. Run mvn dependency:tree and add exclusions for any scala-library or scala-reflect with version 2.12.
